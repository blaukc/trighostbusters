HOW TO PLAY GAME

Player 1 will take the left side of the screen while Player 2 will 
take the right side of the screen.

Assign 4 keys to each button for Player 1 after pressing start.
Do the same for Player 2 next.

Read the lesson thoroughly, then start the game.

Ghosts will move from the middle of the screen to each respective sides.

The objective of the game is to kill the ghosts before it reaches the
player by answering the question above the ghost, with the answers that
will be shown on each key.

Both players must finish the round before you can advance to the next 
round

Each ghost will give a fixed number of points and this number will
increase as the level increases.

Answering a question wrongly or not answering a question in time will 
result in a deduction of points.

When a player loses 3 lives, the round will reset for that player.

There are a total of 6 levels in the game, where the first 5 levels have
different topics of trigonometry and the last level has questions that
use a combination of these topics.

The player with the higher score wins.
